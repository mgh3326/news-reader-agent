Phnom Penh (Reuters) – Cambodia and Thailand opened talks in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday to negotiate a more permanent ceasefire along their disputed border. The meetings were convened by Malaysia’s foreign ministry after weeks of intermittent shelling and small-arms fire that have displaced thousands of villagers on both sides.  
Negotiators from both countries are expected to discuss troop withdrawals, buffer zones, and mechanisms for monitoring the line of control. “We seek a sustainable peace,” said Cambodia’s lead envoy, General Soun Chanthavong, adding that civilians must be protected from further harm.  
Thailand’s delegation, led by Lt Gen Pichai Srisathan, emphasized the need to safeguard national sovereignty and prevent future incursions.  
Analysts warn that lingering mutual distrust could derail progress. “Both sides have historical grievances,” said Dr. Prida Srivijit, a Southeast Asia expert at Chulalongkorn University. “Confidence-building measures will be essential.”  
A fragile ceasefire has been in place since mid-September when both armies agreed to halt offensive operations after weeks of skirmishes. However, sporadic exchanges have continued, particularly in remote jungle areas.  
International observers from ASEAN and the UN have been invited to monitor the talks and ensure compliance. Malaysia’s foreign minister, Anwar Ibrahim, called for a “lasting solution that respects the rights and security of both nations.”

New clashes erupted Friday along the Cambodia-Thailand border, with both sides accusing each other of violating a week-old ceasefire. Witnesses in Oddar Meanchey province reported artillery fire near chapel ruins, while Thai villagers in Sa Kaeo province said they hid in shelters as mortars exploded overhead.  
Cambodian officials said their troops were responding to unprovoked shelling by Thai forces. “We fired back in self-defence,” said Colonel Heng Sothy of the Cambodian army. Thailand’s military spokesman, Colonel Narong Pongpipat, denied the accusation, claiming that Cambodian units had advanced into Thai-held territory.  
The renewed hostilities come just days after foreign ministers from both countries met in Kuala Lumpur. Observers fear that absent stronger guarantees, the ceasefire will collapse entirely.  
Humanitarian agencies warned of a growing displacement crisis if the fighting intensifies. “Camps are already overcrowded,” said a Red Cross spokesperson. Local residents expressed frustration at the lack of progress.  
ASEAN has proposed deploying observers, but the proposal awaits unanimous approval. Meanwhile, international pressure is mounting for a diplomatic breakthrough before the dry season ends and monsoon rains wash out roads, complicating relief efforts.

## Article 3: Cambodia and Thailand border conflict escalates

Fresh exchanges of gunfire and artillery between Cambodian and Thai forces saw at least three soldiers killed and dozens injured over the weekend, according to military officials on both sides. The clashes centered on a remote tract of jungle disputed since colonial times, where both armies have fortified positions.  
Civilian populations in the border provinces of Banteay Meanchey (Cambodia) and Sa Kaeo (Thailand) are caught in the crossfire. Local NGOs report that around 5,000 villagers have fled their homes, seeking refuge in makeshift camps. Aid agencies say supplies are running low amid difficult terrain and heavy rains.  
Diplomatic efforts led by Malaysia and Vietnam have thus far failed to produce a binding ceasefire. Analysts point to deep-rooted territorial claims and nationalist sentiment in both countries as obstacles to peace.  
“Without a clear demilitarized buffer zone, neither side trusts the other to refrain from opportunistic attacks,” said Dr. Sophea Chea, a researcher at the Cambodian Institute for Security Studies.  
ASEAN foreign ministers will convene next week in Jakarta to discuss the crisis, with the potential for economic sanctions if hostilities continue. However, some member states are wary of alienating either Cambodia or Thailand, both key regional players.

## Article 4: Violence flares again on Cambodia-Thailand border

PHNOM PENH (AP) — Heavy weapons were fired on both sides of the Cambodia-Thailand border on Sunday, shattering a shaky truce reached earlier this month. Cambodian military sources said they were responding to Thai artillery bombardment near the 855-kilometre frontier that has long been disputed.  
Thai officials, however, insisted that Cambodian units initiated the exchange by crossing what they consider their sovereign territory. The border region has seen periodic flare-ups since July, when ancient temple complexes first came under fire.  
Aid workers report that displacement camps are nearing capacity, with shortages of clean water and medical supplies. The International Committee of the Red Cross has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities to allow humanitarian access.  
Efforts to broker peace included talks in Kuala Lumpur and informal dialogue in Hanoi, but no concrete agreements have been announced. Observers warn that ongoing rivalry over land rights and national pride will complicate any resolution.
